# HMRC Frontend

HMRC Frontend contains the code and documentation for patterns specifically designed for HMRC.

[GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) and the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) contains the code and documentation for design patterns designed to be used by all government departments.

The two sets of code and documentation are separate but used together.

See [HMRC Design Patterns](https://design-resources-for-hmrc.herokuapp.com/design-library/) for examples of what the design patterns look like and guidance on how to use them in your service.
