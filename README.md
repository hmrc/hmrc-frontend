# HMRC Frontend

HMRC Frontend contains the code and documentation for patterns specifically designed for HMRC.

[GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) and the 
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) contains the code and documentation for 
design patterns designed to be used by all government departments.

The two sets of code and documentation are separate but used together.

See [HMRC Design Patterns](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/) for examples 
of what the design patterns look like and guidance on how to use them in your service.
