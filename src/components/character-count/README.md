# HMRC Character count

The HMRC Character count allows for an optional language parameter of `en` or `cy` to be passed to the `govuk-frontend` Character count component, allowing Welsh language messages. 

Find out when to use the character count component in your service in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/character-count).
