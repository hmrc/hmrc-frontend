# HMRC Account Menu

This component was updated in PLATUI-1419 to match current implementation used by PTA.

## Basic functionality

- if the viewport is small, show the extra menu link (showNavLinkMobile)
- if showNavLinkMobile is triggered, open the main nav (subNav)
- if a menu link (accountLink) is triggered, close sub-nav (subNav)
- if showNavLinkMobile is open, close it when triggered
